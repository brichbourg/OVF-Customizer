###(built for Multi-Tier App Demo - https://github.com/brichbourg/Multi-Tier-App-Demo)

I am a network/systems engineer that is trying to teach myself Python programming.  I am not a developer so please feel free to fork this repo and clean up/improve my code as I am still learning.  

##Information
This is a Python script that will take parameters from OVF environments (via VMWare Tools) and install them to the server.  This script is for the Multi-Tier App Demo script I built.  This script will be used in deployment of MTAD via OVA files to other demo environments.

##Requirements

sudo pip install xmltodict

##Notes

This script is still a work in progress.  It is not complete yet.
